Remember to read the Documentation included!

RESOURCES:

The dialogues you create with the VIDE Editor will be stored inside the Dialogues folder inside Resources. 
These files contain all of the data required for your interface to work. 
You may duplicate and rename them, but it is not recommended as it can cause file name discrepancies. 

It is adviced to keep back-ups of these files in a different folder outside the project. 

The dialogue files are interchangeable between projects, just make sure that they are inside the VIDE/Resources/Dialogues folder! 

The Localized folder will keep .json files with localization data of each dialogue. 
Do not modify these files in any way.

---

VIDE_Assign: Component attached to every game object that will have a dialogue. Optional.

---
DEMOS:

You'll find 6 example scenes that you can study and play around with. 
"Player Interaction" is the main, biggest demo. 

---
DATA:

Do not use/edit any of the files within these folders.

---
EXPORT:

You can export and import dialogues as text files for easy edit outside unity.
Text files will be exported to this folder.
